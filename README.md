# QR_code-generator
LinkedIn QR Code Generator This Python script generates a QR code for easy access to my LinkedIn profile. It takes my LinkedIn profile URL as input and outputs a QR code image in PNG format. The QR code can be scanned using any QR code scanner app on smartphones, which then opens my LinkedIn profile page in the user's browser.
